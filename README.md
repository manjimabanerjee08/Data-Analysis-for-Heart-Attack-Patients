# Data Analysis for Heart Attack Patients
This study helps understand the relation of cholesterol levels with a patients' age, acting as predictors. This model indirectly shows us the likelihood of an individual to experience a heart attack by measuring the respective health factors.
The data for our project is taken from all the patients who have suffered from a heart attack. It gives us detailed information on the counts for their biomarkers such as Cholesterol, Resting Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Fasting Blood Sugar, Chest Pain Type and many others. These factors are strongly linked to an individual’s pulmonary system and therefore help us check tendency of an individual having a heart attack, find probable causes for it and also focus on the necessary solutions or ways to reduce vulnerability to it.

## Research Question
‘Does the level of Cholesterol change with the age of patients who have had a heart attack?’. This question can help the population and medical professionals to understand how age may cause variations in cholesterol levels and how it indirectly affects the tendency of having a heart attack.
